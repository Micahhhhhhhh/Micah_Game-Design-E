Welcome to my Hangman Game! The objective of the game, is to guess the word before 
you run out of guesses. You will be given 6 guesses each levek to guess the game!

After the game is completed, you will have the option to either play again, or exit the game by using keys Y and N, 
Y meaning Yes, N being No. 

Your score will be based off of the number of guesses and the length of the word you'd be trying to guess!

GOODLUCK :)))
